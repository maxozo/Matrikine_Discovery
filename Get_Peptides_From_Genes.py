#Writen by Matiss Ozols on Jauary 2018
#Code preforms peptide generation analysis based on Prosper outputs generated on stand by prosper run on Condor Manchester.
#the code also searches which other skin proteins according to MSP contain the particular peptide and in which domain.
#this is further used to derive 4mer and 5mer peptides used for testing in skin cosmetics by Sederma and WBA.
